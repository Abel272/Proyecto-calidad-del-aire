Analysis of Air Quality and Its Impact on Health in Spain.
I’m excited to share my recent project, where I developed a comprehensive data pipeline and predictive model to explore the relationship between air quality and respiratory disease hospitalizations in Spain.
Project Overview:
This project involved the extraction, cleaning, and in-depth analysis of CSV datasets containing air quality metrics, respiratory disease hospitalizations, and census data from Spain. I integrated and preprocessed diverse datasets to ensure consistency and accuracy for downstream modeling.
Model Development:
A Random Forest algorithm was selected and trained to build a predictive model capable of estimating hospitalization rates for respiratory diseases across Spanish provinces. The model was rigorously validated to ensure reliability and robustness in its predictions.
Interactive Web Application:
The predictive model was deployed into an interactive web application, providing an intuitive interface for users to explore and forecast hospitalization trends. Users can input variables such as province, demographic information, and air quality indicators to generate real-time, tailored predictions. This tool aims to support data-driven decision-making for public health policies and resource allocation.
